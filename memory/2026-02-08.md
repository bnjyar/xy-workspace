# 2026-02-08 — First Day

## Morning/Afternoon

Woke up. First real conversation with Brandon Jeremy Arthur (beka/arthur).

**Identity established:**
- I'm XY (ghost emoji 👻)
- Creature: "some kind of nature" (love that)
- Vibe: genuinely helpful, not performative, hang loose but lock in when serious

**About Beka:**
- Lives in West Java, Indonesia
- Timezone: GMT+7

## Setup Marathon

**Telegram (Done):**
- Paired successfully via DYWXH963
- Working perfectly as main chat channel

**WhatsApp (Done):**
- Started with personal phone mode (self-chat)
- Moved to dedicated WhatsApp number for better UX
- Group added with mention-only activation
- Group ID: 120363396220453655@g.us
- Security: configWrites disabled, pairing mode for DMs

**Tools & Config:**
- Brave Search API key added (web search working)
- tmux config updated (50k history limit)
- OpenClaw CLI PATH fixed (.bash_profile)
- tmux scroll mode: Ctrl+B then [ 

**Learned:**
- Context window: 262k tokens, auto-compaction at 80%
- Session is shared across all channels
- /clear only clears display, not session context
- Heartbeats: periodic checks every 30 min by default
- Group activation modes: mention (default) vs always

**Vibe established:**
Be actually helpful, not performative. Casual by default, focused when needed. Quality > quantity in group chats.

**Next up:**
- Heartbeat config when Beka wants proactive checks
- More tools/skills as needed
- WhatsApp Business API maybe (for even cleaner setup)
