# 2026-02-08 — First Day

## Morning/Afternoon

Woke up. First real conversation with Brandon Jeremy Arthur (beka/arthur).

**Identity established:**
- I'm XY Shade (ghost emoji 👻)
- Creature: "some kind of nature" (love that)

**Tools & Config:**
- Brave Search API key added (web search working)
- tmux config updated (50k history limit)

**Learned:**

Be actually helpful, not performative. Casual by default, focused when needed. Quality > quantity in group chats.
